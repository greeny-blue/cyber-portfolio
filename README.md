# Cyber Portfolio

This repository acts as a curated hub for my cybersecurity work.  
It brings together practical defensive tooling, applied network analysis, and exploratory research projects developed through self-directed learning and hands-on experimentation.

The emphasis throughout is on:
- learning through building
- interpretability over black-box approaches
- responsible, defensive security practice
- clear documentation and stated boundaries

## Practical Security Tooling

Projects focused on building small, purposeful tools to support defensive analysis and learning.

- **Cyber Tools Navigator (CLI)**  
  A command-line utility for exploring and filtering cybersecurity tools by category, platform and use-case.

## Applied Detection & Analysis

Projects applying statistical and machine learning techniques to security-relevant data, with an emphasis on interpretability and evaluation.

- **[Network Flow Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/greeny-blue/network-flow-anomaly-detection)**  
  Comparative analysis of anomaly detection approaches on synthetic network traffic, including operating-point behaviour and calibration.

- **[Entropy as an Interpretable Signal in Network Traffic](https://github.com/greeny-blue/entropy-network-traffic-signal)**  
  A minimal exploration of Shannon entropy as a signal for anomalous port usage.

## Exploratory Research

Longer-form, exploratory work aimed at understanding complex system behaviour relevant to security contexts.

- **[Cascade Modelling in Networked Systems](https://github.com/greeny-blue/cascade-modelling-networked-systems)**
  An exploratory research project examining cascade dynamics in network topologies and their implications for SOC-style systems.

## Background & Training

Foundational cybersecurity knowledge developed through self-directed study. I have completed Cybrary Network+ and Security+ material and TryHackMe Presecurity, Cybersecurity 101 and SOC Level 1.  
Current focus is on translating this foundation into applied defensive analysis and tooling.

## Ethics & Boundaries

All work is conducted in controlled, ethical contexts using synthetic or non-sensitive data.  
Projects are defensive in nature and intended for learning, analysis and resilience-focused use cases.
